# Computer Graphics

## Building the Project

To build the project into an executable just type the following command into the terminal when you are in the root directory.

    make
    
## Running the Project

Running the project requires that you have an `.obj` model file available. There should be an example teapot model in the root directory. Once you have this you can run the program by typing the following command into the terminal.

    ./viewer <name of model file>

## Moving the Model in the View

There are a number of keyboard controls that you can use to manipulate the object.

* Up/Down/Left/Right Arrow = Rotate the Object
* W/A/S/D = Translate the object
* Z/X = Zoom Out/In

## Evidence that the Program Runs

A screenshot of the program's output can be found in the file `teapot.png`.

# Computer Animation and Visualisation: Assignment 2

Matriculation Number: 0824586

## About

Back-to-front ray casting is used to compute the colour of each rectangle in
the image. Simple anti-aliasing is used in order to smooth the image.

## Compiling & Running

Make will compile and then run the program with the `head.vol` file.

	$ make

## Usage

The program starts with some sane defaults to achieve a good looking image. The
transparencies of the different densities can be changed with the following
keys.

q/a - Increase/decrease the opacity of the skin/muscle.
w/s - Increase/decrease the opacity of the bone.
space bar - Toggle Anti-aliiasing on or off.

== Work Done

Skeleton movement and skinning have been completed with transform matrices and
linear blending respectively. The code is almost a direct translation of the
equations in the notes with that addition of some caching of the transformation
matrices in order to reduce the time it takes to re-render the image.

The majority of the interesting work is done in the `update()` function which
is called after any of the joints are rotated. This function does 4 tasks:

 - Calculates the new positions of the joints with any new rotations.
 - Caches all of the new transformation matrices to stop the recursive matrix
   chain calculation being called for every skin vertex.
 - Skins the model using linear blending.
 - Schedules a redraw of the image.

Other code that I have changed is mainly in the `Skeleton` class. This class
does all of the storage and calculation of the matrices and weights.

== Compilation

== Controls

The model can be controlled with buttons on the keyboard.
